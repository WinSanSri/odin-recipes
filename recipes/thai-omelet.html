    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A simple Thai omelet for one of those days when you're feeling a bit more on the more lazy side but still want to eat something mouth watering.</p>
    <p>If you don't already know how make this dish, you're missing out!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
        <li>2-3 tbsp cooking oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl and add fish sauce and oyster sauce. Whisk it all together.</li>
        <li>Heat up some oil in a pan (or Wok if you have one) and pour in the mixture. Make sure the oil is very hot!</li>
        <li>Fry it until itâ€™s a bit crispy and turning light brown.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The Thai omelet should be eaten together with freshly cooked rice for the best taste! If you want to be a bit fancy, you can add minced chicken or vegetables like tomatoes or onion to make it more filling.</p>
